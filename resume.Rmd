### Background

I am an graduate student at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities. For my PhD I am studying fishery bright spots. During my master’s I focused on how we can use Environmental DNA (eDNA) to detect Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS). Broadly my research interests involve how anthropogenic factors impact aquatic ecosystems and how we can mitigate these impacts. I use a variety of quantitative approaches to understand how we can protect our amazing aquatic resources from future climate change and invasive species changes.

### Graduate Research Assistant

MAISRC, University of Minnesota

St. Paul, MN

Present - 2021

- Organized and analyzed fisheries independent data collected from state and federal agencies constituting thousands of surveys over nine decades from multiple states to determine hot spots and bright spots of fish populations.
- Developed and carried out sampling protocols for AIS eDNA in 21 Minnesota lakes In collaboration with two other universities.
- Performed literature reviews on topics such as eDNA, anthropogenic factors impacting walleye and yellow perch populations, and copper impacts on freshwater organisms. 

### Junior Scientist

University of Minnesota

St. Paul, MN

2020 - 2019

- Independently developed a method to increase the efficiency of converting lake bathymetry maps to area-at-depth data using ImageJ. Extracted area-at-depth data from over 1000 Minnesota, Wisconsin, and South Dakota lakes.
- Created R scripts for comparing seagrass abundance captured from GoPro photos to abundance extrapolated using side-scanning sonar.
- Collected hundreds of littoral and deep-water fish and invertebrate samples. Processed samples for stable isotope analysis while working in a team setting.


### Undergraduate Research Assistant

University of Minnesota, Native mussel project

St. Paul, MN

2020 - 2018

- Seined, snorkeled, and electrofished in stream and lake habitats to capture a variety of Minnesota fish and mussels to use in mussel-fish host suitability trials.
- Assisted in building, programming, and testing a submersible robot capable of videoing mussel-fish interactions in a riverine environment.
- Composed six reports of research results and shared the results with the macological community through presentations and papers.
